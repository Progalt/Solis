***Small and fast with a lua-like syntax.***

Everything you would expect from a programming language. Suited to embedding in your application or to use standalone. 

```lua
function main()
	
	var i = 0; 
	while i < 10 do

		println("Hello");
		println(i);

		if x == 5 then
			println("Wow 5!");
		end 

		i = i + 1;
	end
end

main();
```

***Small and fast with a lua-like syntax.***

Everything you would expect from a programming language. Suited to embedding in your application or to use standalone. 

```lua
function main()
	
	var i = 0; 
	while i < 10 do

		println("Hello");
		println(i);

		if x == 5 then
			println("Wow 5!");
		end 

		i = i + 1;
	end
end

main();
```

The language was designed with game scripting in mind but is suited for a variety of uses much like Lua. Unlike lua, it has more object oriented style objects meaning not everything is a table, and there 
is built in support for more types. 


With a fully featured C API for embedding the language easily.

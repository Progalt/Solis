# Solis 

Solis is a simple programming language with a lua-like syntax and an easy to use C API to bind it to whatever you need. Or just use it as a standalone language like you would python. 

Heres a snippet of what the langauge looks like: 
```lua
function main()
	
	var i = 0; 
	while i < 10 do

		println("Hello");
		println(i);

		if x == 5 then
			println("Wow 5!");
		end 

		i = i + 1;
	end
end

main();
```

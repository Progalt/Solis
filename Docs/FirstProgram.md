## Writing your first program

### Humble Beginnings

Getting your first Solis program of the ground is easy and a Hello World tutorial would take mere seconds, so we'll show you how to do that and a bit more. 

```
println("Hello World!")
```
There you go. Hello World done. Let's run it, make sure to save first. 
```
solis HelloWorld.solis
```
And if everything goes well, which it should. Otherwise its a bug... and thats on me... :| 
You get this output: 
```
Hello World!
```

Simple really, you've learnt how to print to the terminal and how to run a solis program. 

But you probably want to do more with it.
